# SASmarkdown
This is a collection of R functions that extends knitr's capability for using SAS as a language engine.

You can install these as an R package:
```
devtools::install_github("Hemken/SASmarkdown")
```
Then you can check with
```
library(SASmarkdown)
help(sas_enginesetup)
```
If the package installed correctly, you should see an R Help page.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please "fork" it on Github and then clone it back to your working environment.  Make your changes and enhancements, push them back to your Github repository, then initiate a "pull" request.

While this procedure may seem overly elaborate, this allows us each to keep the parts we like, even if we should disagree!  (Iâ€™ve been really happy about this at least twice, as the forking user.)
