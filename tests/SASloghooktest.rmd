## An Output Hook for PROC PRINTTO
In this example I am using the PROC PRINTTO method of capturing the log.
In this approach, we use SAS code to save a log file.  In a separate code
chunk we use R code to read this log file and place it in our document.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
  # saspath <- "C:/Program Files/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe"
  saspath <- "D:/SASHome/SASFoundation/9.4/sas.exe"
  sasopts <- "-nosplash -ls 75"
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=saspath, engine.opts=sasopts, comment="")
```

In addition to the usual set up code for working with SAS (the \"sas\" or
\"sashtml\" engines), we need to define an *output* hook.
```{r outputhook, message=FALSE}
  # require(SASmarkdown)
  hook_orig <- knitr::knit_hooks$get("output")
  knitr::knit_hooks$set(output = SASmarkdown::sasloghook)
```

Note that **all** R output is run through the output hook, but our alterations
are specific to the SAS log (none of the things we are searching for
and removing appear in R output), so SAS output is untouched.

```{r procmeans, engine='sas'}
proc printto log="saslog.log" new;
proc means data=sashelp.class;
run;
```

The log is then processed when it is shown by a separate code chunk (using
R commands, not SAS).
```{r readlog}
cat(readLines("saslog.log"), sep="\n")
```

Some variations.  No processing times, SASproctime=FALSE.
```{r readlog, SASproctime=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
```

Some variations.  No SAS command echo, SASecho=FALSE.
```{r readlog, SASecho=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
```

Some variations.  No SAS NOTES, SASnotes=FALSE.
```{r readlog, SASnotes=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
```

Clean up.
```{r cleanuplog}
# Do not forget to remove the log file when you are done!
unlink("saslog.log")
```

## A Source Hook for the \"saslog\" Engine
with the \"saslog\" engine, we would need to use the same function as 
a *source* hook.  Again, the usual SAS set up is needed, including
setting up the engine.
```{r enginesetup}
require(SASmarkdown)
sas_enginesetup(saslog=saslog)
```

### Hook Specification
Next we redefine how \"source\" is
displayed. (Notice we reset the \"output\" hook, from above.)
```{r sourcehook, echo=TRUE}
knitr::knit_hooks$set(output=hook_orig)

hook_orig <- knitr::knit_hooks$get("source")
knitr::knit_hooks$set(source = sasloghook)
```

### Hook Use
First, the code.
```{r procmeans2, engine='sas', eval=FALSE}
proc means data=sashelp.class;
run;
```

And in use.  (Notice there is no file to clean up.)
(There is also no code for PROC PRINTTO.)
```{r procmeans2, engine='saslog'}
```

And a variation on the log, no processing times, SASproctime=FALSE.
```{r procmeans2, engine='saslog', SASproctime=FALSE, results='hide'}
```

### Interactions (or Lack Thereof)
Chunks in other languages are unaffected.
```{r sourcetest1}
runif(5)
```

and, with the \"sas\" engine.
```{r sourcetest2, engine='sas'}
proc means data=sashelp.class;
run;
```
